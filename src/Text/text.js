Name-Game is a fun way of seeing how well you can identify your colleagues, and hopefully learn their faces a bit better.',

Click on the photo that matches the name to win points!  But beware, for each incorrect click you make, the number of points you can earn will be reduced by one.  When you click on the correct face, you will be taken to another group of photos, until you click on the "Discontinue" link in the Toolbar.'
